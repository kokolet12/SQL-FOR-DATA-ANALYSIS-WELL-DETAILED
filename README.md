![sql intro pic.jpeg](https://github.com/kokolet12/SQL-FOR-DATA-ANALYSIS-WELL-DETAILED/blob/main/sql%20intro%20pic.jpeg)
## Introduction
This data has a set of projects and exercises that showcases my skills as a Data Analyst, who is comfy in data analysis using MY SQL
## Problem Statement
- Increase the salary of employees.
- Update the name and age of employees.
- Include the previous salary of employees as a new column.
- Add another column named "department code."
- Filter the data to include only employees with a salary greater than $15000
- And other problem solving statement.
## Data sourcing
Not until after stating these questions, before I went ahead to search for a file that suits it. The file contains Employee info, Employyes salary and superstore data.
#### Data manipulation
*The following queries were gotten with these codes to get a better understanding of this project.*
-	Return Staff ID, Yearly Increment and salary

## Recommendation
- Use SQL queries to extract employee data from the provided SQL file, focusing on salary increases, employee names, ages, and previous salaries.
- Utilize SQL's ALTER TABLE statement to add a new column named "department code" to the dataset.
- Apply a WHERE clause in SQL queries to filter the dataset and retrieve only those employees with a salary greater than 15000.
- Consider using SQL JOIN operations if necessary to combine data from multiple tables, such as employee information and salary details.
## Conclusion:
In conclusion, by leveraging SQL queries and data manipulation techniques, we were able to extract valuable insights from the provided SQL file regarding employee salary increases and identify high-earning employees. Additionally, we successfully enhanced the dataset by adding a new column for department codes. These findings can inform decision-making processes related to employee compensation and resource allocation within the organization.
