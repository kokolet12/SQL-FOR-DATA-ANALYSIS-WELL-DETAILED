# Employee Info and Superstore Analysis using SQL
## Introduction
This data has a set of projects and exercises that showcases my skills as a Data Analyst, who is comfy in data analysis using MY SQL
## Problem Statement
- Increase the salary of employees.
- Update the name and age of employees.
- Include the previous salary of employees as a new column.
- Add another column named "department code."
- Filter the data to include only employees with a salary greater than $1500
- And other problem solving statement.
## Data sourcing
Not until after stating these questions, before I went ahead to search for a file that suits it. The file contains Employee info, Employyes salary and superstore data.

-	Average Profit =AVERAGE(L2:L701)
-	Lowest Profit =MIN(L2:L701)
-	Highest Profit =MAX(L2:L701)
-	Number of Transactions =COUNT(L2:L701)
-	Profit Margin =W2/W1.







#### Data manipulation
*The following KPI’s were gotten with these formulas to get a better understanding of this project.*
-	Total Revenue =SUM(A2:A701), Total Profit
-	Average Profit =AVERAGE(L2:L701)
-	Lowest Profit =MIN(L2:L701)
-	Highest Profit =MAX(L2:L701)
-	Number of Transactions =COUNT(L2:L701)
-	Profit Margin =W2/W1.
